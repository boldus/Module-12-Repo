## Description
Employee Tracker is an application that allows the user to keep creating, reading, updating and deleting data related to specific employees. Upon launching the app, the user has the option to view all employees, view employees by department, add an employee, remove employees, add departments, and add roles. The program uses a "MySQL" database to store information for the user. When the user chooses an option, the corresponding table appears in the terminal.
